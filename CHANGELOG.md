# > CHANGELOG

The following updates have been highlighted for each release. Note that `enb` employs a `MAYOR`.`MINOR`.`REVISION`
format. Given a code initially developed for one `enb` version and then executed in another (newer) version:

- If `MAYOR` and `MINOR` are identical, backwards compatibility is provided. Some deprecation warnings might appear,
  which typically require small changes in your scripts.

- If `MAYOR` is identical by `MINOR` differs, minor code changes might be required if any deprecated parts are still
  used. Otherwise, deprecation warnings are turned into full errors.

- If `MAYOR` is larger, specific code changes might be needed for your code. So far, a single `MAYOR` version (0) is
  used. The next mayor version (1) is expected to be backwards compatible with the latest release of the 0 mayor branch.

# Current development version: v1.1.0-dev

**Important**: although backwards-compatible, this version

- Adds new columns to ImagePropertiesTable.
- Changes the default persistence, plot and analysis dirs, and
- Makes `import enb.icompression` invalid, although enb.icompression is set to enb.compression.icompression
  (the module's new location).

Therefore, the first time you re-run a previously existing enb experiment:

- enb will need to proces again all indices of any table based on `enb.isets.ImagePropertiesTable` 
  (including those within compression experiments). This applies one np.unique call to each
  sample, which should be reasonably fast even for moderately large sample sizes.

- enb will not find your CSV persistence files in the persistence dirs that were default until
  (but not including) v1.1.0. This can be solved either by (a) moving the existing persistence to the new
  default location, or (b) explicitly setting the persistence paths to your tables/experiments.

Additions:

- Added the `bitshuffle` plugin that applies the bitshuffle transform before compression
  and after decompression.
- Added `enb.isets.ReindexVersionTable`, an ImageVersionTable subclass that compacts histrograms 
  and produces versioned datasets. Also added as a codec wrapper in `enb.compression.wrapper.ReindexWrapper`. 

Improvements:

- The number of unique sample values of an image is now stored by ImagePropertiesTable
- Fixed random file name generation that had a chance of crashing compression experiments 
  for every codec/sample combination.
- Enhanced robustness of *.ini configuration files and the `enb.ini` plugin. 


# Latest stable version: 2024/10/28 v1.0.5

Improvements:

- Fixed a problem that prevented values in .ini files from being recognized
  (persistence_dir, base_dataset_dir, analysis_dir, output_plots_dir)
- Fixed regression bug that prevented some columns from being populated if they were defined after the table's
  persistence CSV file was created.
- The enb.ini plugin is now installed with all options commented-out, ready for the user to modify at will

Deprecations:
- Fixed enb.atable.ATable's typo: dataset_files_extension becomes dataset_file_extension.
  The old name will be kept for now as a deprecated property.

# Version history

## 2024/9/8 v1.0.4

Improvements:

- Enhanced documentation explaining how to store compressed and reconstructed files in compression experiments
  (see https://miguelinux314.github.io/experiment-notebook/lossless_compression_example.html#saving-the-compressed-and-or-reconstructed-files).
- Improved error handling of images files with non-compliant names.
- Fixed some external library warnings due to API changes (numpy, pandas)

## 2024/5/19 v1.0.3

Improvements:

- When failing to build/install a plugin with `enb plugin install <plugin_name> <destination>`, a copy of the
  incomplete installation dir is copied to a temporary dir so that you can attempt a manual installation.

- The `corpus` column now treats symbolic links within the dataset folder as regular files.
  This way:
    - One can arrange data samples from multiple sources and still have a consistent corpus name.
    - One can change the name of a symbolic link, and that name will be employed within the experiments.
    - One can mix symbolic links and regular files as needed.
      For instance, the following dataset folder setup (`->` indicates a symbolic link):
        * Would assign corpus `"C1"` to samples `A.txt` and `B.txt`, and `"C2"` to samples `B.txt` and `C.txt`,
          regardless of the physical folders where those samples are.
        * The data in `/home/shared/altsource/some_name.txt` would be known as `datasets/C1/B.txt` to the experiment.
        * File `datasets/E.txt` is not a symbolic link and is treated normally.
  ```
  - datasets/
    - C1
      - A.txt -> /data/source1/A.txt
      - B.txt -> /home/shared/altsource/some_name.txt
    - C2
      - C.txt -> /home/shared/altsource/C.txt
      - D.txt -> /data/source2/D.txt
      - E.txt  
  ```

- Added `lc`, a lossless codec that wraps the LC Framework functionality.

## 2024/02/06 v1.0.2

Improvements:

- Enhanced progress reporting of parallel row computation. You can test it in your scripts invoking them with
  `-v` or `-vv` or, equivalently, adding `enb.config.options.verbose = 1` or `enb.config.options.verbose = 2`
  to your code.

- Messages displayed with `enb.logger` (and, by default also with `print`) are now colorized based on their priority.
  You can easily configure the styles by installing the `colors-default`, `colors-dark` or `enb.ini` plugins
  (e.g., `enb plugin install colors-default .` in your project folder) and modifying the installed `.ini` file,
  and/or by modifying the `style_*` members of `enb.logger`.

- Added the `compression_results` and `decompression_results` properties to `enb.icompression.CompressionExperiment`,
  which are `enb.icompression.CompressionResults` and `enb.icompression.DecompressionResults` instances, respectively.
  These can be called from functions that set row columns of compression experiment subclasses. For instance,
  they can be used to access the original, compressed and/or reconstructed file paths, e.g.,
  ```
  import enb
  
  class CustomExperiment(enb.icompression.LosslessCompressionExperiment):
     def column_first_compressed_byte(self, index, row):
          """Set the 'first_compressed_byte' column of the experiment.
          """
          with open(self.compression_results.compressed_path, "r") as compressed_file:
              return int(compressed_file.read(1))
  ```

- Added the `grid_alpha`, `subgrid_alpha` and `tick_direction` to the `enb.aanalysis.Analyzer` class.
  These parameters can also be managed with `.ini` files (see the `enb.ini` plugin), or passed directly
  to the `get_df` method of Analyzer subclasses.

Bug fixes:

- Prevented spurious exceptions while shutting down, which could happen when an `enb.atable.ATable` instance
  is created but its `get_df` method is not called.

- Using relative imports (e.g., of plugins or other modules within the project folder) now works for remote
  ray clusters. A small refactoring related to identifying local and remote nodes, as well as adapting
  paths relative to the remote mount point when needed has been introduced, too.

- Added missing `h5py` dependency to `setup.py`.

## 2024/01/01 v1.0.1

After 4 years of development and a lot of user feedback, switched from beta status to stable/production!

**NOTE**: This version change does NOT imply a change in the API (backwards compatibility with 0.4.x is expected).
However, a cleanup of old blobs was performed on the repository. 
You might need to use `git pull --force` to update your local development repository. 

New features:

- Added the `enb.aanalysis.ScalarNumericJointAnalyzer` class, 
  which allows numerical data analysis considering two classifications
  at the same time. Useful to produce 2D tables (also in latex format) with categorical columns and rows.
  (Check out the [documentation](https://miguelinux314.github.io/experiment-notebook/analyzing_data.html#joint-numeric-analysis-double-categorical-grouping)).
- Added support for group comparison in the `enb.aanalysis.TwoNumericAnalyzer` 
  class when the `line` render mode is requested.
- Added a plugin for the Montsec codec. You can install it with `enb plugin install montsec plugins/montsec`. 

Improvements:

- Enhanced plugin installation messages and behavior.
- Improved computation time of ATable.get_df when part of the rows already existed.
- All `enb.aanalysis.Analyzer` subclasses now accept single strings in the `selected_render_mode` argument. 
  Previously, a list empty or containing mode names was mandatory. 

Bug fixes:

- Fixed regression bug that prevented the `plot_title` from being displayed on `enb.aanalysis.Analyzer` subclasses.
  Also added a `title_y` parameter to their `get_df` method to allow manual title height adjustment.
- Fixed a bug in the `enb.icompression.LittleEndianWrapper` class that prevented lossless reconstruction.
  Updated the HEVC codec to accept 16 bit samples (now that the endianness is properly handled).

## 2023/09/15 v0.4.5

New features:

- Added a plugin that can apply the direct and inverse BWT (Burrows-Wheeler Transform). 
  It uses the codec API (compress, decompress), although no compression is actually performed.
- Added a plugin for the LPAQ8 codec.
- Added support in `enb.isets` for reading and writing BIL and BIP raw data orderings. Added the BIPToBSQ
  and BILToBSQ ImageVersionTable subclasses to facilitate curation of BIL and BIP datasets.
- Tested on a Raspberry Pi (improved installation instructions for this platform.)

Behavior changes:

- When computing the dynamic range of integer samples in `enb.isets`, 
  this value was obtained considering only the difference between
  the `minimum` and `maximum` sample values. Therefore, if `maximum-minimum=1`, then the dynamic range was set as 1 
  even if min and max are large values, e.g., 4094 and 4095.
  From version v0.4.5 onwards, the 
  dynamic range B is the minimum integer so that all data samples lie in 
  `[0, 2^B-1]` for unsigned data and in `[-2^(B-1), 2^(B-1)-1]` for signed data.
  The calculation for floating point data is not changed, and is always `8*bytes_per_sample`.
  **Note**: This change affects only the `dynamic_range_bits` column of `enb.isets.ImagePropertiesTable`, 
  the `psnr_dr` column of `enb.icompression.LossyCompressionExperiment` and the sample precision selection 
  of the `lcnl` (CCSDS 123.0-B.2) and `kakadu` (JPEG 2000) plugins. 

Other changes:

- Removed ray as a dependency when installing enb.
- Speedup of experiments with a large number of tasks/target indices. Only chunk_size needs to be touched.
- The `task_label` column is now by default the task's class name (elements of the tasks' param_dict are not
  included in it anymore).
- Fixed CLI argument parsing for some numerical values. 
- Partial code cleanup using pylint.
- Removal of the byte_value_* columns in ImagePropertiesTable to speed up compression experiments with
  large files.
- Speedup of enb.aanalyis.Analizer subclases with more than one render mode.

## 2023/01/16 v0.4.4

Small improvements:

- Fixed bug in `enb.plotdata` when the y limits were explicitly set to None.
- Added the --disable_progress_bar flag to supress the display of the animated progress bar
  (useful to minimize the stdout output volume, e.g., for logging purposes). This helps executing enb in
  headless and virtualized platforms.
- Added compression/decompression resident memory size for WrapperCodec subclasses.

## 2022/12/02 v0.4.3

New features:

- Added the classic JPEG codec to the jpeg plugin
- Added the `apply(self, experiment, index, row)` to the `enb.experiment.ExperimentTask` class.
  This method is now called by the `enb.experiment.Experiment` class and its subclasses
  before computing any other row.
- Added the `iraf_photometry` plugin that allows automatic photometry processing using IRAF
  (IRAF must be installed separately).
- Added the `enb.icompression.GeneralLosslessExperiment` that allows seamless execution of lossless compression
  codecs on files without needed to add image geometry information to their name nor change their extension
  (e.g, general files).

Improvements:

- Updated kakadu and FAPEC codecs to specify the exact dynamic bit range instead of the nominal one,
  which allows compression of 17-28bps images stored in u32be and s32be formats.
- Added support for 4-byte entropy and 4-byte entropy efficiency.
- The CCSDS codec now uses 1 sample per packet to allow automatic compression of wide images.
- Cleanup of the lcnl codec wrapper.
- Added the "image" category for image processing and compression plugins.

## 2022/10/26 v0.4.2

- Improved error text when not enough data is available in the scalar analyzer class.
- Fixed the lossy compression template plugin so that it does show data instead of using alpha=0.
- Added the `file_version_example` plugin that demonstrates the use of `enb.sets.FileVersionTable`.
- Created a documentation page about `enb.sets.FileVersionTable` and its subclasses.

## 2022/09/19 v0.4.1

- Added the `--report_wall_time` flag and `enb.config.options.report_wall_time` variables to allow
  compression experiments to report wall clock time instead of the total CPU process time.
- The Kakadu coder with MCT now allows selecting the number of CPU threads.
- Fixed plotting module so that figure heights smaller than 3 can be selected.

## 2022/06/09 v0.4.0

- **Not backward-compatible** changes:

    - Several command line options have been removed, and/or moved to `*.ini` files
      (e.g., in your project folders - use `enb plugin install enb.ini .` to copy a full `*.ini` template)
      and direct object manipulation. These are:

        - `--no_ray`: By default, ray is not the default parallelization engine anymore. To use ray, one needs
          to specifiy `--ssh_cluster_csv_path` or, alternatively, set the `ssh_cluster_csv_path` field in
          the `[enb.config.options]` section of your `'*.ini'` files.
          Run your script with `-h` for additional
          information on this parameter and/or check the
          [documentation on cluster configuration](https://miguelinux314.github.io/experiment-notebook/cluster_setup.html)
          .

        - A number of plot rendering configuration options have been removed from the CLI and are now
          accessible via the `[enb.aanalysis.Analyzer]` section of `'*.ini'` files, direct class
          or instance manipulation of `enb.aanalyis.Analyzer` classes and/or instances, and as
          the `**kwargs` argument to Analyzer.get_df(), in turn passed to the `plotdata` module.
          The affected options are those previously defined in `RenderingOptions` (now also deleted):

            - `fig_height`, `fig_width`
            - `horizontal_margin`, `vertical_margin`
            - `group_row_margin`
            - `legend_column_count`
            - `show_grid`, `show_subgrid`
            - `global_title` (removed, use `plot_title` instead)

General improvements:

    - The position of the legend can now be configured. 
      The `legend_position` parameter can now be passed in `plot_pds_by_group()`'s kwargs, 
      and configured via .ini files (under the `[enb.aanalysis.Analyzer]` section).

    - Compression experiments now compute the execution time as the minimum of all repetitions,
      instead of the average.

Bug fixes:

    - Fixed a "disk leak" problem in `enb.icompression`, which caused deleted files to take space until the script
      finished, due to unclosed file descriptors.
    - The 2D analyzer now correctly sets the y label to the name of the y column instead of the group name.
    - Fixed wrongly displayed warnigns when invoking the CLI with parameters.
    - Caught another potential failing point in aanalysis when fewer than 2 different samples are retrieved, 
      when calculating linear regression parameters.
    - A few codecs intended to be lossless now raise an exception when dealing with data types for which they are not.

## 2022/04/20 v0.3.6

Important: a new dependency was added in this version; you will need to install `enb` again if you had installed
with `pip install -e path_to_repo` and have only updated `path_to_repo` to the latest version.
This is done automatically if installed from pip.

* New features

    - Added support for plotting histograms of 2d data using colormaps, e.g.,
      see this
      [example](https://miguelinux314.github.io/experiment-notebook/analyzing_data.html#analysis-numeric-spatial-2d-data)
    - Automatic generation of latex-formatted output tables in `enb.aanalysis.Analyzer` subclasses
      (stored by default under the `analysis/` subfolder of your projects).
    - Added a few new data compression plugins:
        - arithmetic codec (`arithmetic_codec`)
        - a non-block-adaptive huffman codec (`huffman`)
        - SPECK (`speck`)
    - Added the `enb.plugins.install` method that ensures a plugin is installed and is able to automatically import it.
      Check out `enb plugin list` for all plugins available in this fashion.

* General improvements
    - Added a SHA256 table of contrib packages, so that the newest version is downloaded if an outdated
      version is in the cache.
    - Improved progress reporting with animation.
    - Added the `average_identical_x` attribute to `enb.aanalysis.TwoNumericAnalyzer`, which allows a cleaner analysis
      by averaging samples which share the same x value (applies to the 'line' render mode only).
    - Improved the default group name sorting to better understand numeric values.

* Bug fixes

    - Fixed Kakadu plugin Sdims axis swap bug.
    - Fixed `file_or_path` argument in `dump_bsq_array` so that it accepts open files as described in the API.
    - Fixed some cosmetic problems in the `enb.aanalysis` module.
    - Fixed DictNumericAnalyzer so that key_to_x is correctly processed if available.
    - Fixed warning messages from numpy/scipy when trying to compute correlations or statistical descriptions
      with a single data point, or constant data.
    - Fixed the makefiles of the `fpack` and `ndzip` data compression plugins.
    - When requested, a copy of the compressed and/or reconstructed files is stored in the configured
      folder for LosslessCompressionExperiment subclasses even if reconstruction is not lossless for those files
      (see the `reconstructed_copy_dir` and `compressed_copy_dir`
      arguments of `enb.icompression.CompressionExperiment`)

## 2022/02/16 v0.3.5

* New features

    - Introduced the `enb show` command to show some useful information. Run `enb show -h` for more details.
    - Added the `boxplot` and `hbar` render modes to ScalarNumericAnalyzer.
    - Added the `'enb.ini'` plugin that allows installation of an editable configuration file for enb.
    - Added the `'matplotlibrc'` plugin that allows installation of an editable matplotlib style template.
    - Added documentation on how to customize the appearance of plots.
    - The ssh+ray-based cluster can now operate on network-synchronized project folders (e.g., NFS), instead of relying
      on the sshfs library.

* General improvements

    - Enhanced the `combine_groups` option for |Analyzer| subclasses, and its documentation.
    - Accelerated the initialization of ray for the case without remote nodes.
    - Plot styling can now be read from `'enb.ini'`.
    - Added subgrid configuration from `get_df` and `enb.ini` approaches.
    - Updated VVC sources to 15.0.
    - Added debug verbosity useful when loading large csv files with large dictionaries or objects.

* Bug fixes

    - Fixed label positioning in some plots with longer labels.
    - Fixed minor ticks when labels are provided.
    - Fixed dictionary plots.

## 2022/01/05 v0.3.4

Mostly bugfixes and cleanup in this version.

- Stability improvement on Windows platforms.
- General documentation enhancement, including README.
- Fixed small bugs in the `montecarlo-pi` plugin.
- Renamed the `enb.config.options.ray_cpu` attribute into `enb.config.options.cpu_limit`.

## 2022/01/04 v0.3.3

**Important**: Removed all deprecated methods scheduled for removal for v0.3.0 (Aug 31, 2021). This breaks compatibility
with the v0.2.* versions, although most encountered issues can be easily overcome by using the new enb.aanalyis.Analyzer
subclasses and their `get_def()` method instead of the old `analyze_df()`.

* New features

    - Added ssh-based multi-computer processing.

    - Added the `reference_group` parameter to the `get_df` method of `enb.aanalysis.Analayzer` subclasses, wich allows
      displaying differences against the average of one group (`group_by` must be used).

    - The project_root attribute has been added to enb.config.options that points to the directory where the calling
      script is. Persistence paths are now stored relative to this project root, and enb **now changes the current
      working dir to that project root**
      upon initialization (also applies to remote functions).

* General improvements

    - Simplified the installation process on Windows, added support when ray is not prsent.
    - Improved documentation and plugins about lossless and lossy compression templates.
    - Added a lossy compression template.
    - Complete review of the documentation with the new classes.

## 2021/11/29 v0.3.2

* New features

    - Added a wrapper for codecs for a yet-to-be-released variable-to-fixed (V2F) forests.
    - Added a wrapper for the upcoming CCSDS 124.0-B-1.
    - Experiments now create a family_label column to simplify analysis.
    - Added support for sorting group rows based on their average value.
    - Added support for grouping based on enb.experiment.TaskFamily lists to enb.aanalysis.Analyzer.
    - Improved documentation, including the most recent plotting and command-line tools and additions.

* General improvements

    - Updated the user manual with the most recent analyzer classes
    - Updated the documentation for the LCNL/CCSDS 123.0-B-2 codec: the binaries are now publicly available but not
      redistributed with enb.
    - Updated the ScalarNumericAnalyzer so that it can display averages (with or without std error bars) without
      displaying any histogram.

## 2021/09/10 v0.3.1

* New features
    - Added a lossless compression experiment template.
    - Added csv to latex utility function in misc for easier and faster report making.

* General improvements
    - Improved overall stability and aesthetic control over plotting with enb.aanalysis
    - Removed the recordclass package as a dependency, as enb's usage did not justify the package's size
    - Enhanced clarity and robustness of the setup.py script to simplify installation via pip
    - Fixed potential method resolution order inconsistencies between class methods and column setters; now the
      intuitive behavior is better enforced.

## 2021/08/31 v0.3.0

Version 0.3.0 is packed with new features and general performance improvements. At the same time, significant backwards
compatibility is preserved with the 0.2 version family:

- Client code: major class names and their methods (e.g., ATable, Experiment, get_df, etc.) retain their name and
  semantics. Several methods and classes have been renamed and refactored, but these are not likely referenced in client
  code. In summary, your client code should be compatible with 0.3.0 if it was with 0.2.8 as long as it did not rely on
  the library internals.

- Data format: the __atable_index column is now included in the CSV persistence. This trades off some extra disk space
  for faster loading times and a little extra traceability. As a result, CSV persistence files produced with 0.2.8 or
  earlier cannot be loaded with 0.3.0 and later.

- Features: all previous features have been retained, and new ones have been added.

New major functions:

- Created the first functional CLI. Can be run with `enb` or `python -m enb`.
- Added a plugin installation subsystem; try `enb plugin -h` for more information.
- New logging subsystem, which allows for a more flexible message output selection with more elegant code

Improvements and other changes

- Improved performance of the ATable population, storage and loading routines.
- Plotting in aanalysis makes more efficient use of parallelization.
- Added several new image compression codec plugins with floating point support, based on the `h5py` library.
- The sequential option is removed, in favor of setting the maximum number of cpus to 1.

## 2021/07/14 v0.2.8

* New functions:

    - Added `enb.atable.SummaryTable` as a way to arbitrarily group dataframe rows and compute aggregated columns on
      them. This has great potential for both analysis and plotting.

    - Some core plugins are now automatically included with `enb` distributions. That is, you will find them
      at `enb/plugins`, where `enb/` is the installation destination folder (e.g., your venv). However, integration is
      not yet complete, and **plugins still need to be manually built**. To facilitate the task,
      the `build_all_plugins.sh` script has been temporarily included as well.

    - Added several new codecs with floating point support.

    - Added the `enb.aanalysis.pdf_to_png` method to easily convert folders with pdf figures into folders with png
      figures. The source and origin folders may be the same.


* General improvements:

    - Improved general stability to different parts of `aanalysis.py`.

    - The `test_all_codecs.py` script has been revamped to more easily describe codec availability of each data format
      class.

        - Now, codecs just need to have been defined (e.g., by an appropriate import).
        - Error logs are output as a new column to the script's persistence output and can be checked in case of need.
        - Note that the `build_all_plugins.sh` is **not** executed automatically, so codec availability may fail until
          it is.

    - Revamped the configuration module `enb.config` with the `options` singleton:

        - Grouping and documentation is automatically taken from the classes and property methods. See the
          new `@enb.singleton_cli.property_class(base_cls)` decorator for more information on this.

        - Improved value verifier/setter system. In addition to CLI-parsing, it allows finer-grain input value
          validation and shaping.

        - All changes should be totally transparent for enb client code. Recall that `from enb.config import options`
          is the preferred way of acquiring the global options instance, then both `x = options.property`
          and `options.property = x` are supported as before
          (except for any additional value checks that may now be performed).

## 2021/06/30 v0.2.7

* New functions:

    * Added support to plot columns that contain dictionaries with numeric values (see
      enb.aanalysis.ScalarDictAnalyzer):

        - String keys are supported. In this case, they are assumed to be class names, and are shown by default as
          elements across the x_axis.

        - Number to number mappings are also supported. Typical examples are histograms, probability mass functions (
          PMFs/discrete PDFs), and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). These can be expressed as a dict-like
          object mapping x to P(x).

        - The `combine_keys` argument can be used to easily plot PMFs/PDFs as histograms, rebin existing histrograms, or
          regroup class names (e.g., one could have data for `arms`, `head`, `legs`, `feet`
          as class names (dictionary key values), and easily combine them into `upper_body` and `lower_body` before
          analysis.

        - More generally, any object that supports the comparison interface can be used for the key values, as these are
          sorted by default.

    * Added codec support:

        - enb.isets.FITSWrapper can now be used to easily define codecs that need `.fit`/`.fits` files as an input.
        - Added FPACK, FPZIP, ZFP, Zstandard codecs for FITS (potentially float) data.
        - Added standalone Zstandard codec.

    * enb.iset-based tables can now inherit from enb.isets.SampleDistributionTable to automatically compute dictionaries
      containing probability mass functions.

    * Disabled ray's dashboard by default to speed up script startup and termination time.

* Bug fixes:

    - Fixed potential problems when defining subclasses of enb.sets.FileVersionTable. One should now be able to freely
      mix and match versioning tables without syntax errors.

    - Fixed FITS codec endianness

## 2021/05/13 v0.2.6

* New functions:

    - FileVersionTable subclasses now can choose not to check the expected output files and use all produced files in
      the versioned dir instead.
    - Added FITS to raw version table

* Function improvements:

    - Improved HEVC and VVC compilation scripts
    - Improved support for datasets consisting of symbolic links to a single copy of the dataset
    - Improved default wrapper codec names when no hexdump signature is desired

* Plotting improvements:

    - Improved the general plot function to increase control over displayed colors.
    - Added `enb.aanalysis.ScalarToScalarAnalyzer` to plot dictionary cell data. Shadowed bands based on std can now be
      depicted.
    - Several minor fix-ups to plot rendering and general stability

* Docs are now displayed on the public site automatically point to the dev banch
