profiler: a simple profiler for the Marlin codec (not thread safe)

Usage:

 	// For each event to be profiled
 	Profiler::start("event_name");
 	...
 	Profiler::end("event_name");

 	Profiler::report(std::cout);

Notes:

  * Events can be nested, but the start and end calls must be consistent.

  * If the same event name is started and ended several times, total duration is accumulated.

  * To completely disable, define the NO_PROFILER macro.
