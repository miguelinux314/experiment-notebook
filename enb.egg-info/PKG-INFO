Description: # Experiment Notebook
        Python library to design, run and plot experiments.
        
        Ideal for cases where:
        
        	- multiple inputs need to be processed by one or more customizable tasks, producing a table of data
        	- one wants to apply custom code to existing data to produce new columns
        	- analysis tables and plots are needed for one or more data columns
        
        ## Installation
        
        On most Linux distributions, you can simply run
        
        	`pip install enb`
        
        On Windows, you may encounter a dependency problem with the `ray` library. To solve it, install `ray` manually (https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html) and then run `pip install enb` normally.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        A [user manual](https://miguelinux314.github.io/experiment-notebook) is available that explains the basics and introduces some ready-to-adapt experiment examples.
        
        You can also take a look at the `templates/` and `plugins/` code folders for some useful examples.
        
        
        You are welcome to submit your extensions via a pull request to the `dev` branch.
