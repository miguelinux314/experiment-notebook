# Experiment Notebook
Python library to design, run and plot experiments.

Ideal for cases where:

	- multiple inputs need to be processed by one or more customizable tasks, producing a table of data
	- one wants to apply custom code to existing data to produce new columns
	- analysis tables and plots are needed for one or more data columns

Also take a look at the `templates` and the `plugins` folder for some examples.
